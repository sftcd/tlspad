# Investigating TLS padding

This repo has (or rather, will have) scripts to investigate TLS padding.
The goal is to try figure if there're useful TLS padding schemes that
help mitigate (not necessarily "solve") traffic analysis attacks, particularly, 
for scenarios where Encrypted SNI might be used. 

This is a side project related to my 
[openssl ESNI fork](https://github.com/sftcd/openssl/blob/master/esnistuff/design.md)

To start with, I need some idea of what packet sizes are used in the wild, so
initial work relates to a [measurement script](dumper.sh) to capture some
packets. Once I have some of those, I'll figure out how I want to analyse
the pcap files.

Note: we won't decrypt or MitM any TLS sessions for this.
